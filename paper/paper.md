# Summary

There are several critical rotating equipment purchased by the industry that are
crucial, such as compressors, pumps and turbines.
Computational mechanical models aim to simulate the behavior of such mechanical
systems, and to support decision making. To this purpose, we present Ross, an open source
library written in Python for rotordynamic analysis.

Ross allows instantiating shafts, disks, and bearing, and join them in order
to instantiate rotors. It is possible to plot its geometry, run simulations, and
obtain results in the form of graphics, by performing Static analysis, Campbell Diagram,
Frequency response, Forced response, and Mode Shapes.
